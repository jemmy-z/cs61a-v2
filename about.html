                <p>
                    I am a third year Computer Science major from the Bay Area (Fremont!), so I've pretty much lived here my whole life. I took my first CS class in senior year of high school and it gradually grew on me. I thought I was pretty decent at the time, but then in CS 61A, I realized there was A LOT I didn't know. While CS 61A is definitely a challenging class, the rewards at the end definitely make the journey worth it. And I'm here to help!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right after I took the course, I become an Academic Intern in Spring 2018 and started learning the ropes of how to effectively teach students the material. In Summer 2018, I became a Tutor for the course and started leading small group sections to further enhance their understanding of the material. Summer 2019 was my first time teacing CS 61A as a uGSI. I'm now back as a Tutor and my goal is for everyone to have a better understanding of the fundamentals of CS.

                    If at any point in the course you wish to meet up with me one-on-one, please send me an email. In addition, include the time(s) you are available and I will do my best to work out a time that works for both of us. Remember, these sessions do not necessarily have to be about the course material or such; you can come talk to me about the process for declaring CS, or other interesting classes to take.
